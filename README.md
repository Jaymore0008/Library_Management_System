# Library Management System (C++)

## Overview
The **Library Management System** is a simple command-line application built in C++. It allows users to manage books in a library, including adding new books, issuing books, returning books, and viewing a list of issued books. This project demonstrates basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Data Structures** (arrays and queues).

## Features
- Add a book with an ID, title, and author.
- Issue a book to a user.
- Return a book.
- View all available books.
- View the queue of issued books.

## Concepts Used
- **OOP Concepts**: Encapsulation, Classes, and Objects.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays (to store books), Queue (to manage issued books).
- **Basic Algorithms**: Searching for books based on their ID.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Jaymore0008/Library_Management_System.git`
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ library_management_system.cpp -o library_system
